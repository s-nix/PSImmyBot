# Cmdlet Reference

Explore more than 900 autogenerated cmdlet pages that describe every PowerShell entry point shipped with `PSImmyBot`. Each cmdlet page lists its backing class, HTTP behavior, parameters, and output types so you can jump straight from documentation to source.

## How to browse

1. Use the left-hand navigation or the built-in search (press `/`) and start typing the cmdlet name (for example, `Get-Computer`).
2. Open any cmdlet page to see its default parameter sets, behaviors, and output contracts.
3. Follow the `Source` link at the top of each page to inspect the corresponding file in `Cmdlets/`.

> Tip: Every cmdlet page is regenerated from source by running `pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -File ./HelperScripts/GenerateDocs.ps1`, so the docs always stay in sync with the code.

## Popular entry points

| Cmdlet | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [Connect-Api](Connect-Api.md) | Authenticates against Azure AD and caches the ImmyBot API token/configuration. |
| [Disconnect-Api](Disconnect-Api.md) | Clears cached connection info when you want to force a fresh login. |
| [Get-Computer](Get-Computer.md) | Fetches a specific computer record from ImmyBot. |
| [Get-ComputersPaged](Get-ComputersPaged.md) | Streams paged computer data with optional filters. |
| [Get-Auth](Get-Auth.md) | Verifies the current authentication context using `/api/v1/auth`. |

## Document structure

- **Behavior** – Summarizes which `ImmyBotApiService` method (GET/POST/etc.) is called and whether helper utilities such as `Globals.ConvertToQueryParameters` are used.
- **Parameters** – Autogenerated table sourced from `[Parameter]` attributes, with positions, mandatory flags, and pipeline settings.
- **Outputs** – Indicates the model returned by the cmdlet or whether it performs orchestration only.
