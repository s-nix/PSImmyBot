title: Model Reference Overview

# Model Reference

This section contains autogenerated stubs for every DTO, request body, and response type defined under `Models/` (over 600 files). Use these pages to locate serialization details quickly, then jump directly into the source for deeper inspection.

## How to browse

1. Use MkDocs search to find a model by name (for example, `AzureTenant`, `MaintenanceAction`).
2. Open the page to see the source file path and serializer details.
3. Follow the `Models/<File>.cs` link to inspect the full record or class implementation.

## When to look up a model

- Understanding what a cmdlet returns (for example, `Get-Auth` emits `GetAuthResponse`).
- Determining which fields belong to a request payload before constructing one manually.
- Auditing the JSON contracts that `PSImmyBot` expects from the ImmyBot API.

## Regenerating documentation

All model pages are created by the same generator that writes cmdlet docs:

```powershell
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -File ./HelperScripts/GenerateDocs.ps1
```

Run the script whenever you add, rename, or remove files under `Models/` to refresh the reference set.
